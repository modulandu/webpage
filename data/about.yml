  title: "We are sound <br /> and music"
  column1: "We share a passion for discovering new sounds and decided to share this passion. So we created Modulandu.
   Music can be modulated in many ways: rhythmically and harmonically, but also historically and culturally. 
   Sounds modulate our mood and our senses, make our body move and our emotions flow. 
   <br />
   <i>Our work is to make your brand, product or channel sound unique and memorable.</i>"

  column2: "It is about feeling, understanding and enjoying music and sounds.
     It is the craft of using the right tools and wisdom of the people who create them.
     We invent and facilitate the development of a sound identity for your product or service.
     <br />
     <i>We can help you improve the sound and music of your work.
     Come with us in this journey.</i>"
